Using Arduino and Vernier Sensors
========

Overview
--------

Vernier has always supported hands-on, do-it-yourself projects for students (or teachers). The availability of very inexpensive, easy-to-program microcomputers,
like the Arduino, makes projects easy and affordable.

We posted a guide to [Using Vernier sensors with Arduino][1]. It is a free guide to connecting, calibrating, writing programs, and doing fun projects with our sensors.
The guide references sketches included in this repository.

All sketches are developed by Vernier.

Include the [VernierLib library][2] in your version of the Arduino IDE to make using Vernier sensors easy.
